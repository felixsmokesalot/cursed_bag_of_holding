# cursed_bag_of_holding

This is a DM TOOL!!!

Lore:

A goblin lives in the bag, and steals random items from areas players would be in. adding to the bags inventory, as a design the bag has unlimited space, but when an
item is removed, it will give back a random item from the ever growing items that are added to the bag. The trigger to add an item from location is on command, by the DM,
while the party is otherwise occupied. 

The tool is still in its early devolopment stages, and more features are  being planned for it. As they are updated they will be implemented into the code here. I am 
working on building a gui into it as well. 

current fucntions

Start new bag -  starts a new bag, with 21 random items within it.
selecting no will load the previous sessions bag, and no items will be lost.  can only support one game session currently, work around would be to save file in multiple
directories, as that is how the bag gets loaded.

add to bag - allows players to put their own items in the bag, one item at a time
add random item - adds a random item from choice of locations: tavern, general store, curch/holy temple, smith, or from the master list of items.
remove from bag - gives a random item back from the items in the bag.


The current items in the bag save after every action, so there is no data loss.
